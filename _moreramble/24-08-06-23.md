<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Magenta.</span>
So be it! I'll float <i>here</i>.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
Keep the train as a hostage;<br>
We need a link backwards.
</p>

<h3>II.</h3>
<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">The Gateman.</span>
Hi. Can I check your identity?
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
I am <i>the</i> wanderer. I believe I can overpass here.
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">The Gateman.</span>
May I see your hands?
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Mm?
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">The Gateman.</span>
You don't have any hair on hands.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
That's an odd thing to point out.

<h3>III.</h3>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Not to lie, I am afraid<br>
To get too distant from the world<br>
Where the time flows most consistently<br>
And uncontrollably, the place I wanted<br>
To escape -- but I will reshine there.<br>
For though corrupted it is, <i>they</i>'re still worth undoing.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
If this is not the last, at least that it leave something...
</p>
