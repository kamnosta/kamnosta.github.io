<h3>I. Arrival.</h3>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Red.</span>
Are we above or below?
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Blue.</span>
I can't tell. It wouldn't matter.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Magenta.</span>
I see a concrete desert with cuboid towers.<br>
Are these what we saw above?
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
I don't know. We'll see.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
How were these structures formed anyway?
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
Hmm...
<strong><i>[kicks one of them]</i></strong>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">B.</span>
Don't do it, you're spreading the dust!
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
I feel anxiety.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
Face the other side for a while;<br>
Gotta mark our presence here.
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">B.</span>
I'd say we leave them as,<br>
For these are natural structures.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
I need alcohol.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
With us being here it never is natural.
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">B.</span>
Wouldn't it be that <i>we</i> are not natural here?
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
I feel dissected and displayed for mockery.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
We are natural in all spaces.
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">B.</span>
I just don't see the point of this. They will form again, naturally.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
I can't be here.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
I'm setting a precedent, friend.<br>
The others will follow, and nothing<br>
Will stand the wave we'll generate.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Hey! I see a hollow structure there. We can get in and have some alcohol.
</p>

<h3>II. Inside.</h3>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Alcohol. Alcohol. A gun.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
Don't overreact. Even if you had a gun...
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">B.</span>
I regret to say that it's not likely for us to find any alcohol here, mate.
</p>

<p class="clr-w-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">The Worker.</span>
Hi. Do I know you people?
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Not likely. But I always prepare for the worst.<br>
Do you have by chance any alcohol around here?
</p>

<p class="clr-w-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">The Worker.</span>
No.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Ah, what god have I displeased?
</p>

<p class="clr-w-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">The Worker.</span>
Are you going through something?
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Ah, no, I'm just, exposed to a new wall.
</p>

<p class="clr-w-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">The Worker.</span>
I feel that.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Oh, huh?...
</p>

<p class="clr-w-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">The Worker.</span>
You've had a rough day, hmm?<br>
Out of your cell, lost in a new maze,<br>
Situations that come and exhaust you.<br>
What you keep on your cell are exhibited by your own mouth,<br>
To feed the very mouth. Stuck in a room you chose to be in.<br>
I've been through the same. And I feel the same seeing you.<br>
Here, come...
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Oh.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
Hey! What do you think you are doing?<br>
We didn't get here to recrawl into another cell!<br>
When you hated this world and yourself in it you had a clear direction to walk on!<br>
Now you're enclosed by <i>another!</i> What goes in your head right now?<br>
Don't you think what you're receiving right now contradicts with what you said before?<br>
You were trembling to hold yourself, and now you're almost crying!<br>
What she is giving you is a poison!
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">B.</span>
Enough! Enough of it.
</p>
