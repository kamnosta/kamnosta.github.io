<h3>I. Both the bunny and the possum continue.</h3>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Red.</span>
Off it, damned opposum!<br>
And you, slut, drop your petty smile.<br>
Letting you unbound was my mistake.<br>
I will lock you inside me, have fun with the feral rabbit!
</p>

<p class="clr-w-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">White.</span>
Please calm down...<br>
You're shaking the air of my house.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
Release him so we can get out of here!<br>
What are you anyway?
</p>

<p class="clr-w-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">W.</span>
One whom he'd better be with.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
So that you smother him?<br>
See, he's already getting numb!<br>
But only temporarily; when it wears off<br>
He'll fall under the regret and be more lost.<br>
You are just injecting a hard drug of emotion.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
Hey, you, can you even think?<br>
What could you even do there?
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Magenta.</span>
On a fine suit, reading papers,<br>
With the others, sitting inside,<br>
In Luck's good favors, I can get some income.<br>
-- And in the end I could be with my love...
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
False hope! Stupid promise.<br>
Your love was a figurative one! Not what's possible for you to get.<br>
And that's why it's beautiful! Now wake up.
</p>

<p class="clr-w-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">W.</span>
He fell asleep.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
Sweet dreams, idiot.
