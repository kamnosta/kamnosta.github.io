<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Magenta.</span>
I don't even know what I am to me.
</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
This is not I; I am not of this world.
</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
I am dead inside. Hate is only what I feel<br>
And only what makes me alive is you...
</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
I feel no shame either, as said.<br>
I was gonna write equally terrible<br>
About futility and that I don't cry.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
I'm just lying on my bed.
</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
I love you so much.
</p>
