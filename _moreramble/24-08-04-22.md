<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Magenta.</span>
I stand this foul air no more.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Red.</span>
Where shall we head?
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Far from here, as possible.<br>
Put me in one of the trains.
</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Sometimes I wish the train to march forever.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
With the <i>others</i> present?
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
If they remain as passengers<br>
And the Nature stand outside<br>
With a library filled...
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
Without your <i>love</i> present?
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
It stays in my heart, as you said.<br>
And when I can't bear it anymore<br>
I'll have the earth embrace me<br>
-- My heart will fulfill the job...
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
Dying in this cell.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
What, should I prove by burning?<br>
It isn't my fault, you'd know.<br>
It's outrageous, their cells...
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
We've arrived.
</p>
