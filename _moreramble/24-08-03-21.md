<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Magenta.</span>
It's fainting.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Red.</span>
They that displease you?
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
In faith they will be crushed,<br>
But until the day where what I see<br>
Would not crash with my iterations,<br>
Have them be observed by me.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
I want to hurt them.
</p>
