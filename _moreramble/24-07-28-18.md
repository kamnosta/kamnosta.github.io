Ha! What a <a href="/illusts/240727-255-0-255">swiftblink</a>.<br>
Merely an object<br>
You are. I will undo you.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Red.</span>
It appears to have<br>
The arrows from within,<br>
That are similar to ours.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Sacrilegious.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
So was the cross we see<br>
Before he the inverter,<br>
Who set his time as the axis<br>
And rendered himself eterenal.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
I see, my heart, a sign of overcoming.<br>
A man died here and tore the box,<br>
Along with his drawings of selfshooting.<br>
And in the last selfemission, the whole world<br>
Will tremble and be desolated for their sins.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
Still this box delects me not.<br>
Its edges will strike through anyone<br>
Who misunderstand then mistreat it.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
I will take care of it.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
With she the other representation?<br>
I have not forgot it, as you may see<br>
I remember what to be remembered,<br>
Contrary to how I pretend otherwise.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
You can believe me, I have them locked<br>
Within me, along with your wounds forgotten<br>
And the love you'll never forget.
