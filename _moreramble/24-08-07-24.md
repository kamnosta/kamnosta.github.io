<h3>I. Enter Blue the feline.</h3>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Blue.</span>
We meet again.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Magenta.</span>
What do you hold?
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">B.</span>
I will help you with your heading.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Okay, I need to whelm the underworld.
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">B.</span>
Hmm, how do we do that?
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
I thought you could help.<br>
Nobody understands me, and<br>
You're only confirming that<br>
It only hurts me to share.
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">B.</span>
Up, you impatient.<br>
I'll buy you a drink.
</p>

<h3>II. A tavern.</h3>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Fuck you all. I'm not changing.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
It's the world that has to change for its outrages.<br>
And these people, they don't even realize this!<br>
They have to be cleared too.
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">B.</span>
Can you just not care about them?
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
I care about me in that world.<br>
But I can say that I've adapted;<br>
Yet this means not that I tolerate them.<br>
It's that while intensifying my will against them<br>
That contrast me from this barren world<br>
I'm abandoning the false emotion, which<br>
Beguiled me to stray unto the sympathy<br>
-- How would I be same to <i>them</i>?<br>
How would I <i>be</i> in them!
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
And, why is everyone not aware of this outrage!
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">B.</span>
Eh! Eh! Savages<br>
Are they, have become<br>
Numb. Ignore them!<br>
And concentrate on here -- <i>beyond</i> there!
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Red.</span>
<i>He</i> deserves to overflow!<br>
The question is this:<br>
How can his power <i>here</i><br>
Be translated into the other worlds?
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">B.</span>
It's bound to the local rules,<br>
So what needs to be done is to fit the universal laws.<br>
Which would require to find the laws themselves.
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
Deo favente, the path will be disclosed.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
<strong><i>[sings]</i></strong>
Ah! I love you! I miss you! I want to be with you!<br>
You'll have to kill me to stop this heartbeat!
</p>

<p class="clr-b-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">B.</span>
Ah, more alcohol! More!
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
Float! Forget all for now.
</p>
