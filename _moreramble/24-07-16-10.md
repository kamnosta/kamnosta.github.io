- *Magenta.* This sweet yet bitter fragrance. I always notice when I get near here. Yet I don't know where it comes from, for nothing is around here.
- *Red.* By here being nowhere it becomes the contrastor between the binary realms. The perception you notice is from your inner body, *from your melting heart itself.*
- *M.* Sounds poetic.
- *R.* Your heart melts by the three:<br>
One. The bittersweet love for a man.<br>
Two. The bitter love for the world.<br>
Three. The distressing love for the destiny.
- *M.* Sounds non-sense -- Also what do you mean by "love for the world"? You'd know I despise it...
- *R.* It is because you care about it, you see, when you see the other side...
- *M.* No, I don't even want this reality *to be associated with me*. You are wrong here, and I don't see the point of this allegory.
- *R.* I can show you then!<br>
**(Cuts *Magenta*'s chest open.)**
