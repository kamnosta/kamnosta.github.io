<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Red.</span>
<i>There you are!</i>
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">Magenta.</span>
I still have the will to go!<br>
I will tread on strange lands<br>
And whelm the rotten wastes.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
But peculiar!<br>
You look quite <i>feral</i> now!
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
That's not I.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Then <i>what</i> is this?
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
A new representation of <i>your</i> Heart.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Are there more hearts?
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
No, just thine one.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
How many are the <i>representations</i>?
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
Two, I and she.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Then I'd guess she's from what I've gone through.<br>
Whence one question arises: Where art <i>thou</i> from?
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
I've been with you since your breath,<br>
I am your protorepresentation.<br>
And <i>she</i> is only secondary;<br>
She shall be under my command --<br>
Speaking of which, I'll take care of her.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
I will believe you, for it better be true.<br>
My Heart! You never tell me what goes,<br>
But if I don't understand what goes<br>
In this world, it cannot be mine!
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
I know by heart, O Vessel,<br>
That you'd ignore what I'd tell you.<br>
The solution is simple now:<br>
We have to change this world<br>
To fit your orthogonal rules.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Your words delect me.
</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Now, what do we with this remnant,<br>
The former body I wore<br>
That I will not associate with me?
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
Leave as. It's insignificant.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
Have you heard of a young German wanderer<br>
Who burnt all his poem, for poems can't be<br>
Mediocre but are only good or bad?<br>
It's the same reason that I have <i>nothing</i>.<br>
And I have never written a poem<br>
But ramblings. You will remember<br>
That I don't know music or poetry.<br>
But my heart senses the rhythm and emotion<br>
That we share on this world, O love...
</p>

<p class="clr-r-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">R.</span>
Allons-y.
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
<span class="mr-name-span">M.</span>
My old body and womb!<br>
That thou burn in the last day<br>
And the ash reach the heavens<br>
To smother the dégénérés!
</p>

<p class="clr-m-w">
For fresh air I walk on.
</p>
