- *Magenta.* Okay...
- *Red*. How do you feel?
- *M*. It's been a while since I last went to church. I went there *to feel something*. While It was reaffirmed that I'm not a religious person, I enjoyed the mass. For two millenia a tradition for a man survived. Then can it be really refuted if one says *He* lives? Can it be refuted that *He* lived after His *death* in a martyr's life, if he lived and died for Him? For me I'm putting that if it aligned with *la beaut√©*, the believed is true. But it can't be said to the *others*.
- *R.* Hmm.
- *M.* So why did we come here?
- *R.* I wanted you to feel how it feels to attend a mass in a great cathedral.
- *M.* This cathedral is certainly huge. And it being a tourist spot there were a lot of foreigners. But it felt too *common* for me. \
By the way... Did you take the Eucharist?
- *R.* Yes.
- *M.* Have you been baptized?
- *R.* No.
- *M.* You shouldn't do that, it is required.
- *R.* But you don't even believe in God. If they know what you write on the Internet you would be excommunicated, at least figuratively by those who know you.
- *M.* Yeah, but it's a disrepect unneeded and avoidable.
- *R.* If you say so, but I wouldn't be attending a mass anymore.
- *M.* So, why did we do it again?
- *R.* We have to create the forces like we've seen. First we need a base, like this cathedral. Do you know any good spot?
- *M.* Mmm... No.
