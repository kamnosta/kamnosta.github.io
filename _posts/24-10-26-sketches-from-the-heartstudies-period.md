title: Sketches from the Heartstudies period
---

- *Heartstudies: from 24.06.28 - 24.10.10*

As the time has come.

That is, those moments where I feel futilities can't do anything.

## Early sketch of [Heart #3](/heartstudies/240630-heart-3-l-ionien-pathetique) #1
*24.06.28*

The heart present and blessed. The blessers should be the Cyanic siblings.

To burn.

## Early Sketch of [Heart #3](/heartstudies/240630-heart-3-l-ionien-pathetique) #2
*24.06.29*

And the giver of the heart -- low.

## Sketch of [Discontent](/heartstudies/240711-discontent)
*24.07.05*
![/imgs_sketches/240705_discontent_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/240705_discontent_s0.png)

Was composed earlier than [*Alone*](/heartstudies/240709-alone).

## Sketch of [Alone](/heartstudies/240709-alone) #1
*24.07.08*
![/imgs_sketches/240708_alone_0_sk0.png](/imgs_sketches/240708_alone_0_sk0.png)

Drawn as needed.

## Sketch of [Alone](/heartstudies/240709-alone) #2
*24.07.09*
![/imgs_sketches/240709_alone_2_p0.png](/imgs_sketches/240709_alone_2_p0.png)

The output was the first attempt at the non-*minimal* coloring.

## Bikedirection
*24.07.17*
![/imgs_sketches/240717_bikedirection_0.png](/imgs_sketches/240717_bikedirection_0.png)

Oh, I was gonna draw this with a digital-heavy artstyle. Was planning to compose in Blender then forgot about it.

Anyway from this [He to be redrawn](/posts/240718-wip-he-to-be-redrawn) was drawn and [the subsequent attempts to compose](/posts/240722-wip-s-of-drunk-and-uncentered), leading to [Drunk and Uncentered](/heartstudies/240722-drunk-and-uncentered), which is... a mess.

## Sketch of [Misanthropia](/heartstudies/240728-misanthropia)
*24.07.28*
![/imgs_sketches/240728_misanthrope_1.png](/imgs_sketches/240728_misanthrope_1.png)

"Some cells, from distance, can look interesting." -- likely somewhere in this website

## Sketch of [The Lifting of the Head](/heartstudies/240802-the-lifting-of-the-head)
*24.07.31*
![/imgs_sketches/240731_headholding_0.png](/imgs_sketches/240731_headholding_0.png)

The drawing I like the most from this period...

## Early sketch of [Enter White the Possum](/heartstudies/240820-enter-white-the-possum)
*24.08.13*
![/imgs_sketches/240813_possum_s2.png](/imgs_sketches/240813_possum_s2.png)

I have to draw her more.

## A study on White the possum
*24.08.16*
![/imgs_sketches/240816_possum_s3.png](/imgs_sketches/240816_possum_s3.png)

Snouts.

## Sketch of [Morerameble -27-](/moreramble/27)
*24.08.17*
![/imgs_sketches/240817_mr27_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/240817_mr27_s0.png)

Also the dramatis personae for [Splitramble](/splitramble/).

Including Red the bunny, who wrote the early writings that I really can't read again.
To her defence, she read early 19C English poets (while not understanding it) and wanted to emulate its style, including its vocabulary.

## Sketch of [Heart Open](/posts/240825-wip-heart-open-to-be-redrawn)
*24.08.22*
![/imgs_sketches/240822_heart_open_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/240822_heart_open_s0.png)

I don't think this one is getting more touch.

Oh yeah, have I mentioned that I had kept what to draw? Like shown in [Lac Illustrandum](/comics/240514-lac-illustrandum). Gonna list some 'cause they won't be realized:
- *4th decl*: Likely that I wanted to express that I didn't like the 4th declension of Latin. Which was short-sighted since I've learned to see its fanciness. Oh I see, I hated the dimorphism between the masculine nouns (cf. *fructus, fruct√ªs*) and the neuter nouns (cf. *cornu, cornus*). Justified in this case.
- *knows not where he goes*: A bicycle-related... Maybe have been relized as *Bikedirection* above or vaguely somewhere in *Moreramble*. (Since it's an early entry, it also can be in *Schramble*, esp. [-8-](/schramble/8).)
- *My head*: Oh! forgot to draw this one -- ay, this may be related to [He to be redrawn](/posts/240718-wip-he-to-be-redrawn) (subtitled: *dissected*.)
- *i eat buildings*: Half-realized as [Schramble -6-](/schramble/6). *Devoring* buildings still is an interesting concept.
- *unmagentas*: Where *Magenta* would be de-magenta'd.
- *kamnosta.net like houses*: Still a nice idea.
- *paint tube*: From paint tubes, Magenta (or other) as liquid.
- *pressing pressing pressing*: Sandwich. Vaguely related to [Splitramble -9-](/splitramble/9)
- *bike aimless floating*: This must be the *Bikedirection* above.
- *vomit*: Oh I was gonna draw this soon.

Oh I still had ideas. I just had low will...
I was trying to make a short "animation" (that'd hardly qualify with its definition) but I soon got too tired -- like just now -- well I always draw at night, and I usually take a nap after or before having dinner, a habit I've been gradually avoiding -- without which it became really hard to draw at night. Well what if I just draw at other times? Well here's one: I only have the cringe-powered energy at night -- that's similar to what Red the bunny would write. On mornings and days I prefer killing my time reading books (that isn't related with my major and that which I'm supposed to make money and feed myself with). And after absorbing the relating thoughts (not knowledge) I express it on night. Well as said I've been trying not to sleep after having lunch and this is the reason why I've been not uploading for a week. Oh! I've been finishing the animation concept, like [that of Sq3](/waterleveller/241020-sq3-concept), but for all eight sequences of 'em. Yeah the script is finished... But wouldn't finish it at least until the next February. This long deadline gives me the non-hastefulness but also lazyness. I have to nought-ize this idleness with drawing... oh I want to draw [Lewis](/waterleveller/241015-dramatis-personae). Let's start with the *vomit* one first. No it wouldn't be dirty.
Ah before drawing him I have to note that Lewis is a bad person.

Where was I...

## Sketch of [Splitramble -1-, #2](/splitramble/1)
*24.08.27*
![/imgs_sketches/240827_sp0_2_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/240827_sp0_2_s0.png)

Contained.

Oh it's past the satisfying-sleep-hour and after that retrospect above (I hope that's actually readable unlike the past ones I wrote while drunk and much more depressed) I have more to say... But that one word seems to suffice.

## Sketch of [Splitramble -2-](/splitramble/2) #1
*24.08.29*
![/imgs_sketches/240829_spltr2_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/240829_spltr2_s0.png)

This should be the perfect place to elaborate on the Blender usage. (I thought of this while writing the entry above)

## Sketch of [Splitramble -2-](/splitramble/2) #2
*24.08.30*
![/imgs_sketches/240830_spltr2_s1.png](/imgs_sketches/240830_spltr2_s1.png)

So that "rigged" model was done right after [the head was done](/scenes/240626-have-i-mentioned-the-cells) but was never mentioned. *He* also was used in [Splitramble -12-](/splitramble/12), which can be why Blue slightly looks stiff.

Oh wait I used Blender (but not *him*) in [Splitramble -5-](/splitramble/5) too. Gotta add it too...

## Sketch of [Splitramble -4-](/splitramble/4)
*24.09.01*
![/imgs_sketches/240901_spltr4_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/240901_spltr4_s0.png)

Just looks funny.

I had to edit the bunny's face not to look... she's floating in the aether already.

## Early sketch of [Splitramble -5-](/splitramble/5)
*24.09.05*
![/imgs_sketches/240905_spltr5_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/240905_spltr5_s0.png)

The Cyanic siblings.

## Blender render of [Splitramble -5-](/splitramble/5)
*24.09.06*
![/imgs_sketches/240906_spltr5_aetherstation_2.png](/imgs_sketches/240906_spltr5_aetherstation_2.png)

As mentioned above.

## Sketch of [Splitramble -6-](/splitramble/6)
*24.09.06*
![/imgs_sketches/240906_spltr6_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/240906_spltr6_s0.png)

Silly but didn't fit.

## Early sketch of [The Rabbit's Epilogue](/heartstudies/241010-the-rabbit-s-epilogue) #1
*24.10.06*
![/imgs_sketches/241006_mendheart_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/241006_mendheart_s0.png)

She...

## Early sketch of [The Rabbit's Epilogue](/heartstudies/241010-the-rabbit-s-epilogue) #2
*24.10.08*
![/imgs_sketches/241008_epilogue_s1.png](/imgs_sketches/241008_epilogue_s1.png)

Before it was tilted.

Maybe I could write more but... sleepiness...
