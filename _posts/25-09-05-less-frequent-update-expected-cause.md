Fucking gave up after dying to the Last Judge 50+ times -- it's the phase I had to get through (not to mention the "runback") till the point I see the pattern I should get w/ -- My writing now is messy I know,. Said fuck it and used the cheat, and I regret NOTHING 'cause I saw how many hits it required. FUCK YOU!!!

I hadn't such problem w/ the original HK: has my gayming skill regressed or is it of this game

*25.09.16*

Yesterday I fucked off to play other games (found out that `T.F.A.N.C.S.` actually makes games)

Will delete the cheat save & revive the backup file; trying the [Sinner's Road](https://i.redd.it/jkcgohnx0u161.png) route...

I don't know whether it is normal to see the credits before reaching the "Act 3"

Usually when a game throws any ending I consider it to be done and touch it not again, same went for the original *Hollow Knight*, *Cave Story*, *OneShot*, *Changed*, &c., &c.

Haven't played the guitar for weeks...

Fuck you too ant queen from your memory, the cutesy little ant in the left corner first and fuck those two giant ant knights with oversized hitboxes

Why does her heart look like that anyway

How was I supposed to find that Mt. Fay mask shard ~~and Whiteward spool fragment~~ eh fair

Each one had respectively single remaining that I could not find w/o Internet
