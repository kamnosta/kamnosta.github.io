Fucking gave up after dying to the Last Judge 50+ times -- it's the phase I had to get through (not to mention the "runback") till the point I see the pattern I should get w/ -- My writing now is messy I know,. Said fuck it and used the cheat, and I regret NOTHING 'cause I saw how many hits it required. FUCK YOU!!!

I hadn't such problem w/ the original HK: has my gayming skill regressed or is it of this game
