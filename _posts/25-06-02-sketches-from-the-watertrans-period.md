- *Watertrans: from 24.10.11 - 25.05.02*

## First sketch of [Waterleveller](/waterleveller/)
*24.10.11*

It was, as said, already written. The drawing took too long. Too long. The execuse was that the drawing per day grasps the *I* then -- which still holds, 'cause the lesser quality of these drawings can be explained by the claim that I was relatively okay during these days. Maybe it was the prozac. Maybe it was the stable place I could lock myself in. On which *I* is actually I, ...circling question, isn't it.

*24.10.30*

I have the .gif files like [the one posted here](/posts/241020-waterleveller-sq3-concept), act 3 to 8, but wouldn't post it 'cause they do not differ much from the output. (Act 1 and 2 were written after the rest was compiled.)

On this... yes, the first drawing. Not far from the previous ones. As I might have alluded before, I don't like this series -- (hence "forgettable" on the desc). Transitional period... But unlike my life, esp. pre-... the pre-preupload period, it at least... has moments that can leave something.

I should've gotten wine; I'm half-drunk.

## Sketch of [Waterleveller #4](/waterleveller/4)
*24.11.12*
![/imgs_sketches/241112_wl4_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/241112_wl4_s0.png)

During this period I couldn't write anything... As mentioned I was somewhat stable. Even these were drawn from the fragments from the worse hours.

## Sketch of [Waterleveller #6](/waterleveller/6)
*24.11.20*
![/imgs_sketches/241120_wl6_s1.png](/imgs_sketches/241120_wl6_s1.png)

I haven't much to say.

## Sketch of [Waterleveller #11](/waterleveller/11)
*24.12.05*
![/imgs_sketches/241205_wl11_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/241205_wl11_s0.png)

And I'm always here.

Only the ambiental place changes. And the great angst comes from being where he's not supposed to be. To disregard the voices, without being numb, is the only path there.

To the same: Visiting a library, books that deserve not voices (contrary to some idiots!) are often seen. Aginst them express a grand slur without vocalizing.

## Sketch of [Waterleveller #15](/waterleveller/15)
*24.12.19*
![/imgs_sketches/241219_wl15_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/241219_wl15_s0.png)

Likely from the blender render.

## Sketch of [Waterleveller #17](/waterleveller/17)
*24.12.26*
![/imgs_sketches/241226_wl17_s2.png](/imgs_sketches/241226_wl17_s2.png)

The act of his.

## Frag
*25.01.22*
![/imgs_sketches/250122_frag.png](/imgs_sketches/250122_frag.png)

I forgot this existed. There likely would be a reference to this somewhere -- or a referenced?

## Sketch of [Waterleveller #33](/waterleveller/33)
*24.02.21*
![/imgs_sketches/250221_wl33_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/250221_wl33_s0.png)

Enters he.

"...no point in it."

## Sketch of [Waterleveller #34](/waterleveller/34)
*24.02.26*
![/imgs_sketches/250226_wl34_s1_heart.png](/imgs_sketches/250226_wl34_s1_heart.png)

But look at this...

## Early sketch of [Waterleveller #43](/waterleveller/43)
*24.03.22*

~~Seeing.~~ Perceiving. Girl on the left. Through a window.

Compare [Andheleftme #3](/andheleftme/3).

The next Andheleftme would be drawn after I finish re-reading this book.
