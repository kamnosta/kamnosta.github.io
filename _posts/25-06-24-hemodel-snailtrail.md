Continued from [He Gone](/posts/250613-he-gone)

The depth bug is gone!!! The projection matrix was reversing the order of `z`-of-NDC which messed up the depth testing code

Fixed by modifying the projection matrix code meow

*...Does that mean that [Andheleftme #8](/andheleftme/8) has the opposite side of the chamber?*

Fixed; Also it (and this gif too) had wrong framerate

Wasn't gonna change were it not for the framerate issue...
