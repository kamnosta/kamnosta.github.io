## Anyone...
24.Jun?<br>
<br>
Anyone who will lend me a gun?<br>
No one?<br>
<br>
'Cause in a more ideal world I'd have one.

## I miss you...
24.Jun?<br>
<br>
I miss you so much<br>
In this small enclosed room<br>
I only think of you

## Baptize...
24.Jun?<br>
<br>
baptize in my blood

## I see...
24.Jul?<br>
<br>
*[...]*<br>
In this confined room cried I,<br>
And what do you think of it!

## Assert...
24.Jul?<br>
<br>
ASSERT *[...]*; HAVE LEARNED TO

## I need more...
24.Jul?<br>
<br>
I need more acid to kill parasites<br>
And poison the others.

## She
24.Aug?<br>
<br>
DOESN'T WANT HER CREATION TO BE PERCEIVED; HER TOO

## ...Thence
24.Aug?<br>
<br>
...Thence I opened my heart out, which unblinded the blinds, and blinded the unblinds.

## Psychology
24.Sep?<br>
<br>
*[...]* doesn't care about the modern psychology. How amassed and anonymized young American Aryans behave under controlled circumstances doesn't interest *[...]*. It'd be needless to mention about the other approaches involving the human general.<br>
<br>
For it's only depresseing to behold. *[...]* (not written "homoerotic") *[...]* concerned around this pointless discourse. The mere presence *[...]* corrupts *[...]*<br>

## The mountain has two lights
25.Jun?<br>
<br>
The mountain has two lights<br>
It invites me to trouve it<br>
Leaving you, unsearched yet.<br>
<br>
But then I saw the white building<br>
in front of you, which I wondered<br>
its use. One day i traveled thither<br>
and realized...<br>
that it was a military complex.<br>
But the flowery road along it was<br>
too beautiful...<br>
<br>
So does that cube reach you?<br>
I wouldn't know, maybe never will<br>
But you are significant, lights<br>
and the place, in my mind.<br>
<br>
But thence I saw thousands of cell-lights
