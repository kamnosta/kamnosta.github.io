title: "Another overcaffeinated night"

My head is part-obscure... Would do everything & won't do anything...

Next series... will be written w/o set plan... I could draw now but that would be suboptimal...

Look at this start-concept:

## 250821_ahh_s0
*25.08.21*
![/imgs_sketches/250821_ahh_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/250821_ahh_s0.png)

Why `ahh`? That was supposed to be the acronym of *"Ishehalved"* -- that is, `ihh`. Well that works too. But it would change, 'cause the protagonist may not be male -- `ish`?
Another candidates for the name:
- *"Miscmiscmisc"*: centers on the assortedness of the series... But not much linked w/ the content of the series
- *"Overcafeswirl"*: "cafe"... may not be the center of the series...

*"Overmiscswirl"*?

Anyways it will be drawn as-drawn, as-written, with no overobserved control, ...

Unrelated?: I don't re-read my old writings much...

For images in [Posts](/posts/) maintained are two directories: `imgs_posts/` and `imgs_sketches/`. The former is usually used when there is only single image for the post, usually coinciding w/ the post; if I don't post another image the image above would fall under `imgs_posts/`, but this image rather fits under `imgs_sketches/`; also for the completeness:

## Heart for the Andheleftme-schema
*25.06.16*
