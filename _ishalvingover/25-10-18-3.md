- Another pair, in their refuge.

One day they departed from their shelter and visited an alien planet. It wasn't their designated task, for they were bound to a certain contract -- They had come only as visitors. There they saw ...

Glowing lights over the mounts. Are they rising or falling? Ants rotating around the mountain tops...

They descended through the ground, holding a parcel, and encountered a wrecked gate. Inside was a <br>
light white, comparable to none...<br>
Must the C o r e be.<br>

Crawls.<br>
The movables squeak.<br>
Yet scream not I -- here.<br>
Ah! it returns.<br>
I love it.<br>
"Because it makes me think of you more"<br>

So I held the crystal and climbed out.<br>

Good mounts! block the electric lights -- φαινετω<br>
And you will reclaim the earth..!<br>

- Encounter: lacks.

- M: Blue air.

1. Ignore all literature that cites Wittgenstein.

I beheld the earth, and lo: behind the mounts that enclose this city<br>
parallels arose; and in which the visible spectra danced.<br>

I hold this a book - two sections, nearly consequent. By these continential letters I found two girls -- about to be forgotten, so half-awake and half-asleep given a breath.<br>
Yet they are marginal.<br>

Then a man of a short posture apporached and rambled about those who manage the artpieces to be displayed, and asked whether I know the "typical selection process": I did not want to -- why care, and why expect me to care? you justifier and rationalizer: detestable humours, these-and-those without heart... So I walked off.

The room... In which, a couple.<br>
Satisfied with their moment, for they could embrace each other.<br>
The former baron and baroness of their domain, enclosed content were.<br>
Their reign started from the White Stone, and ended with the pursuers.<br>
<br>
He saw over the dome of his land...<br>
And went down the castle, to see the cat girl of the town.<br>
<br>
Out of the sunshone streets entered he into her room,<br>
and embraced her. "Rarely wish I the time to be over..."<br>
<br>
Having warmth of her from the neck, "We are forever<br>
here and now," said she.<br>

"Forever here and now...?"

The sunlight through the window warmed the orange air of the room, and he saw her smile.
