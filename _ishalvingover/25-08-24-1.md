*"Monitor the container surrounding the object of interest. Keep the parameters of the container within the normal range."* is what is written.

The "object of interest" appears to be a condensed particle. It's traveling around the liquid inside the container.

A machine is installed in front of the container -- Likely to control the "parameters" that the paper mentions.

I don't know what these are. I am only here because I could not refuse the request -- which may have been given to me due to it being a trivial task. I'd rather want to *pay* them so that they get another person to do this job, other than me... At least I can do my work while handling this chore. The phone rings...

- Hello?
- Mm. When?
- At that time, on the schedule wise, it may be available.
- Okay.

For other people it could be worse. That thought made me not better but not worse either. The machine...

The blame for the accident fell not unto me, for I was not paid and thus held no responsibility. But the incident on my side, that is the particle having been traveling through my head, was not considered either. They talked over the consequence toward the world from this accident, which did not interest me.

Instead of returning to my space, I walked outside.

Usually seen are the mocking structures and signs, peopled. On *my* skin-level is a mechanism to defend self: to illustrate the schema,

Here the waterwheel is the interface against the general low people.

Weirdly for today the people are not seen much, which is nice; the waterwheel-power is only secondary. Strolled through the half-empty streets. On the ground I saw someone's ID card abandoned. ID card... it's more about having an identification more than identifying. This be my identification:

- NAME: /
- GENDER: trans-sexué
- ETHNICITY: Magentoid

Entering a rather dull building, in front of which stands an ID check gate, passed through well-decorated rooms.

Well lit too. Met a pink bunny girl. On the table was a chess board, on which a map of Europe is drawn.

- <span class="iho-name-span">The pink bunny.</span> You see, every cultivated man has his own Europe in his mind.
- <span class="iho-name-span">I self.</span> Say will I, that I know not how to play chess.
- <span class="iho-name-span">The pink bunny.</span> Just move the pieces as it *make sense*.

*"Make sense"*: How english, methought. The pink bunny, after moving several pieces, including mine, satisfied, started to draw Asia, Africa, America, &c., expanding, on the table, an erasable medium. While she was sophisticating on her art I fell daydreaming, whose content remember I not. She after completing the map, smiling, erased the non-European additions.

- <span class="iho-name-span">The pink bunny.</span> I'm thinking of the outer space.
- <span class="iho-name-span">I self.</span> In the beginning,
- <span class="iho-name-span">The pink bunny.</span> Εν αρχη erat...

But then a cyanoid fox boy hit the table, shaking our attentions.

"The cats", said he, "are coming." We followed him.

- <span class="iho-name-span">I self.</span> There was,
- <span class="iho-name-span">The pink bunny.</span> *Es war ein König in Thule,*

And how had he become a king? Is: all cats are kings . There is a cat-king-of-interest approaching us -- after us: was that which the fox girl, a companie of the fox boy, quoth. It had to be.

![/imgs_ishalvingover/250906_iho_drew_a_circle.png](/imgs_ishalvingover/250906_iho_drew_a_circle.png)

The fox siblings, with their arms stretched, drew a circle on the air; from this a spheric firmament around us was formed, barely containing us.

- <span class="iho-name-span">The fox boy.</span> This separates us from the outside. We cover the entire planet in the same manner to deter the cats.
- <span class="iho-name-span">Bad echo. </span> *I like paths with no lights. But...*
- <span class="iho-name-span">The fox girl. </span> It is expected...

![/imgs_ishalvingover/250908_iho_she_squahed.png](/imgs_ishalvingover/250908_iho_she_squahed.png)

She squashed the bad echos round with her paws, wrapping it with an obscuring firmament; then it was placed on the center of the sphere.

Detached and thinking alone -- but then somepaw pressed the outer firmament. It was rather a refreshing stimulus; I hated this obscured morsel taking my attention. A cat -- a kid was it. He rolled it like a ball, taking us into his place.

> ...

In that foreign place,<br>
stood alone the sphere,<br>
in which four creatures<br>
breathed their airs.<br>
<br>
The sphere parted twofold,<br> 
reproducing self, repeating<br>
till the new cells construct<br>
the original macro-sphere.<br>
<br>
So begotten is a bastard world.<br>

- <span class="iho-name-span">The pink bunny.</span> Such organization can only form in a closed world; consider: *the ever-degenerating spiral, the standardization of sub-standards and the sub-standardization of sub-standards...*
