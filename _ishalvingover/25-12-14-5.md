As exiting I saw something burning.<br>
Small fire on a negligible building,<br>
-- for which a dozen of fire-trucks<br>
tailed a side of the block.<br>

I only saw black smoke out of the window --<br>
which was, uninteresting --<br>
others may have thought the same, for below the fire the café -- they didn't care.<br>
Fair.<br>

I got outside of that block -- yeah, I visited the place I often visited as a kid.<br>
Not much has changed. But I didn't like it much -- the people watching the fire, and ...<br>
So much shall leave as dream-places.<br>

I walked through the roads but the landscape (or blockspace) didn't change much.<br>
It was likely because I crossed the river.<br>
I'm tired. So I took usual way to get back home.<br>

I hate this world.<br>

Well, I had my guitar fixed.

They were on board to another planet. But I prefered this space without gravity. "There has to be a solution to suppress..." I thought eyeing the window, "they that imitate in bad faith the lines... without the ultimate inference..."
Landed; again.
Thence I walked along the trainway (or the wall covering it). It spread over the surface to manifest its grave concrete... yet even there the parasites.

Weh! Weh! Foul smell!
So I left aside and looked up
the blurry star...
"You know... it's always more from above!"
Blurred more.

(Here is whence I see the path)

Ah forget it; they are to be shown.

But for now, I got to take a nap. -- I'll tell you what I saw there. -- Right now I'm a bit tired, ...

First, and impression prima.

[2D]

&: that, even while my soul be designated initially with my body, it is floating.

To talk about imitating automata. The problem is the high-dimensional-output, which had been holding expectations -- the culprit is, as always, the insentient peoples.

To talk about the sibling again. [later]

To talk about that impressio prima again: For now the drawn is not in my hands. It was contained, w/ sizable margins. Such *high-dimension* impressions accompany with text. Next: on divinity.

Now to add, ...

The color of the firmament was changed, but will not differ anymore.

...

Below: an indeterminable shallowness,<br>
and amid earth tepid, I found my body.<br>
Against the gravity and toward the weak light<br>
crawled I. With the difference diminishing<br>
I thought of the Designation of my soul.<br>
Muddy, alone, ... yet with an end.<br>
I layed my body on this closed room<br>
and thought of the girl, one of ...<br>
four and one. It was the midst of my life<br>
when I met her, and wanted to ignore her<br>
praesence in my life. She asked me why.<br>
I couldn't answer her.<br>
<br>
"Might be the influence of the bad actors;<br>
" but I learned, see you, to neglect false<br>
" stories. For, as shown, they were not in<br>
" the heart. Now take my hand, & you'll never<br>
" leave me."<br>
<br>

Morning, we had to get through a tunnel<br>
where outdated machines grumbled without<br>
any purpose. "Abandoned and without light<br>
" are they -- all dead..." But that they reside<br>
on a *vertical* tunnel, doesn't it put?<br>
I saw a ray of light glimmer from the top.<br>
<br>
Slippery walls... but the has taken us up<br>
to the room. In which, numerous rodents.<br>
In one path I met one of the siblings.<br>
What are you doing here? In this closed room...<br>
Then we walked out. We missed its warmth.<br>
<br>
Outside the tunnel: how sad, poor, miserable<br>
is this place. But I will not return even when lost.<br>
It felt like being drowned in the air. So<br>
for a little more amount of the breath<br>
I climbed over the gray hill. Here I await<br>
-- the end... but without me.<br>
<br>
