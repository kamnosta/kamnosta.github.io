*A schema, of custom, regarding the degrade-automata. These automata march on the shallow lattice, on which they leave viscous yet ephemeral liquid, which also fuels their march by natural design. Some clusters show malfunctioning behaviours, which is expected: they break down and fill their contol sections with the fluids, rotting asymptotically, which inflicts neighbors in the radius. While this phenomenon is insignificant to the function of the automata, it displeases the observer.*

said the cat-boy, and he wanted to hunt these typical nuisances. Acknowledging that he hasn't the intention to hurt us -- and kill the fox siblings, we deactivated the sphere.

Then she played her violin. Music that only we know... And she smiled. Felt like an illusion. Who was she? I *remember* her: doubtful is that she is here. She is, *without her form yet*. Not here...

She, with a mask.

We held our hands and walked to her star. In her pastel room were her drawings on the walls. And the doors were locked. At that moment I wanted to see stars above. "Here, this window..." said she. With the window frames it looked like an art piece, with indeterminable depths. The warm lights of the room were displaying the star-window's place... Here I could imaginate behind her mask beyond memories.

Morning. After having a breakfast, she unlocked the door and let me leave, but with a restraint: the collar on my neck that will stay until I find the way to set her free from her *house*.

Outside were south European structures surrounding the streets -- yet the fog took their colors. The road lead me to a gray house. Inside, I felt more lost. A gray cat had me seen* in front of a desk. "Why," said he, "are you not sleeping?" to which "I love her, and I believe in Love..." said I. Rather a bliss, that we know not much each other, for it moves, and...

Then the cat showed me a video of two men talking, which did not take much of my attention.

The illusions, the enclosed, and...

All floats and goes, yet she remains, and...

Hand-countable actors: I have to be one, and...

"I'm weary." were the last words uttered before the groundsteppers awoke me. Yet it did not bother me, for I knew that reaching above again would arrive soon. *"Death to leaky automata,"* the hunter exclaimed -- seen was a unit of automaton nearing us, barbaring detastable murmurs. It circled us around multiple times, leaving its repugnant trails, gradully breaking self down till it was dead. I was rather intrigued on why it showed such behaviour, and wanted to dissect it to examine inside. But "microcosms are often disappointing," said he; so I instead thought of her. It was sweet and sweeter.

Gray stairs and metal doors. One opened. A vast room imitating a street. In which building-like structures -- The girl! I had to be everyone everywhere -- above. So the guy around the round-fence. He smiled gently, and pulled my collar. By warmth he knew why I was here.
