*A schema, of custom, regarding the degrade-automata. These automata march on the shallow lattice, on which they leave viscous yet ephemeral liquid, which also fuels their march by natural design. Some clusters show malfunctioning behaviours, which is expected: they break down and fill their contol sections with the fluids, rotting asymptotically, which inflicts neighbors in the radius. While this phenomenon is insignificant to the function of the automata, it displeases the observer.*

We held our hands and walked to her star. In her pastel room were her drawings on the walls. And the doors were locked. At that moment I wanted to see stars above. "Here, this window..." said she. With the window frames it looked like an art piece, with indeterminable depths. The warm lights of the room were displaying the star-window's place... Here I could imaginate behind her mask beyond memories.

Morning. After having a breakfast, she unlocked the door and let me leave, but with a restraint: the collar on my neck that will stay until I find the way to set her free from her *house*.
