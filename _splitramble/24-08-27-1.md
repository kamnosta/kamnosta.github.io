firstverse: The possum lead us to her room,
---

<p>
<span class="clr-w-mw">The possum</span> lead us to <span class="clr-w-mw">her</span> room,<br>
Which seemed well ordered and clean.<br>
There <span class="clr-w-mw">she</span> against the desk leaned,<br>
And spoke: <span class="clr-w-w">"I put it's safe to assume<br>
That you are from the world I created."</span>
</p>

<p>
Th' excited <span class="clr-r-mw">Red the bunny</span>:<br>
<span class="clr-r-w">"If you the maker of world be,<br>
You'd know it's failing down from inside!"</span>
</p>

<p>
But then <span class="clr-w-mw">the maker</span>: <span class="clr-w-w">"To say, much I know not<br>
Over what goes under there -- I'd not know<br>
Even if I try to, for they look so microscopic from here.<br>
What I only acquire is what's emitted, written, then last.<br>
But to me too appears what you concern; for what I read<br>
Are all from centuries ago.<br>
But man can build upon them."</span>
</p>

<p>
And <span class="clr-b-mw">Blue the feline</span>, questioning: <span class="clr-b-w">"Then, why haven't you<br>
Observed then tried to fix it?"</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="clr-w-mw">The possum</span> says: <span class="clr-w-w">"For still to be read are many.<br>
How many are what's left!<br>
I made the world millenia ago,<br>
In six days, and unplanned, undocumentated.<br>
My only used criterion was: it was good.<br>
In the imperfect world fought imperfect men,<br>
Who lasted arts imperfect. Tell me so:<br>
Was not my world worth it?<br>
With seeing you having crawled up from there,<br>
I am assuming good 'Yes'.<br>
As rarely anyone do come here, oh nay, only you<br>
Were someone came here."</span>
</p>

<p>
To which <span class="clr-m-mw">Magenta</span> says: <span class="clr-m-w">"In there are all I hate<br>
And some and one that love I.<br>
To me it is the reason to live on<br>
And burn all."</span>
</p>

<p>
To which adds <span class="clr-r-mw">Red</span> more: <span class="clr-r-w">"Rather than decaying slowly<br>
A storm destructive should fit."</span>
</p>

<p>
Then <span class="clr-w-mw">White</span> continues: <span class="clr-w-w">"Normally, I do not interfere<br>
To this world, by this project's nature.<br>
But foolishly for me, I've made a mistake.<br>
It's the <i>material</i>, a crucial source for making a world,<br>
I used exceedingly for this world,<br>
Which would not yet be solved within.<br>
As mentioned for I don't have any blueprint<br>
Of this world, any trivial modifications cannot be done.<br>
To penetrate the exofirmament so the material be retreived,<br>
-- Your tasks begin, one has to travel far to seek the solution."</span>
</p>

<p>
To which <span class="clr-m-mw">Magenta</span>: <span class="clr-m-w">"I will then travel again,<br>
But please hold me tight.<br>
I wish not to be lost."</span>
</p>

<p>
Thence <span class="clr-b-mw">Blue</span> approaches the <i>world</i>, the hemisphere behind <span class="clr-w-mw">her,</span><br>
Observing: <span class="clr-b-w">"Then I said that I ignore abnormalities like these,<br>
But I would gladly help you neutralizing this half. All these insects<br>
Have never pleased me, and without them I'd expand my world to it.<br>
If this world were a sphere, I'd kick it like a ball!<br>
It's not that I'd have any choices, right, O Possum?"</span>
</p>

<p>
To whom <span class="clr-w-mw">the possum</span>: <span class="clr-w-w">"We will have a long trip."</span>
