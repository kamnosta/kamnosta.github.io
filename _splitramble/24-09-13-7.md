Barbaric rhythm through a coffeehouse.<br>
<span class="clr-m-w">"These annoying low babblings... I'm weary of 'em,"</span> says <span class="clr-m-mw">Magenta</span>.<br>
<span class="clr-w-w">"Cannot tell if the one that put this audio is evil or just numb,"</span> <span class="clr-w-mw">the possum</span> adds.<br>
<span class="clr-b-w">"Imagine getting 7 bucks per hour and should listen to this base song,"</span> laughs <span class="clr-b-mw">the feline.</span><br>
<span class="clr-r-mw">The rabbit</span> thence: <span class="clr-r-w">"Ah, ceux qui sont n√©s pauvres sont si malheureux."</span><br>
<span class="clr-m-mw">Magenta</span>: <span class="clr-m-w">"Didn't have to say that..."</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="clr-w-mw">The possum</span>, standing up: <span class="clr-w-w">"The scale of this decomposition...<br>
The power output might have certain leakage.<br>
But for now, let us move out. The material should be around here."</span>
</p>

Outside.<br>
<span class="clr-m-mw">Magenta</span>: <span class="clr-m-w">"They are building even more cells near <i>our border</i>!"</span><br>
<span class="clr-b-mw">The feline</span>: <span class="clr-b-w">"To be soon collapsed."</span>
