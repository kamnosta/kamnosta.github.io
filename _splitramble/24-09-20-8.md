<p>
<span class="clr-m-mw">Magenta</span>: <span class="clr-m-w">"That's my cell block."</span><br>
<span class="clr-w-mw">The possum</span>: <span class="clr-w-w">"Something's not right...<br>
It is to be here, under where we stand,<br>
Around it should the Earth surround<br>
To guard its purity.<br>
But what am I seeing?"</span><br>
-- <span class="clr-m-w">"That monoliths -- recently built are all.<br>
Bleak concretes on low asphalts, ah what philistines!"</span>
</p>

<p>
All enter underground.

<p>
<span class="clr-m-mw">Magenta</span> and <span class="clr-w-mw">the possum</span> digging,<br>
That's only filling them with angst.<br>
<span class="clr-b-mw">The feline</span>: <span class="clr-b-w">"Let us burn to show 'em lessons!"</span><br>
But not yet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="clr-w-mw">White</span>: <span class="clr-w-w">"It's to be here.<br>
Even if it travel, it relocates here itself,<br>
For this earth is his verity,<br>
Even when the bleak surroundings aren't of his.<br>
And I see standing still, you,<br>
Who went and bore through too much.<br>
That your roots penetrate this earth.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="clr-w-w">"What trembles, it's the body, from the soul.<br>
We often miss the soul is indeterminable<br>
The moving core. Our bodies only limit.<br>
Eyes capture not one's soul...<br>
The soul embraces with the body,<br>
Of his or one the only lover's,<br>
And thence the body gets the meaning,<br>
So too are his extended body, art.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="clr-w-w">"But your lost body, it beheld your soul,<br>
And feared.<br>
For to expand is soul...<br>
Without a limit.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="clr-w-w">"Now come, and hug me.<br>
The world for you awaits us."</span><br>
-- <span class="clr-m-w">"With he who fills my soul to be eternal.<br>
I want to share my heart with him."</span><br>
-- <span class="clr-w-w">"Sure thing, you..."</span><br>
-- <span class="clr-m-w">"Ah, all I wanted is the softness and the love!<br>
With my love, I want none."</span><br>
So they embrace the given,<br>
But <span class="clr-r-mw">Inner Heart</span>, she was not won.<br>
So pierced are the embracers.
