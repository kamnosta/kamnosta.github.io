<p>
Now all on autowalk.<br>
<span class="clr-m-mw">Magenta</span> murmurs, <span class="clr-m-w">"New aheading...<br>
I wanna soar high.<br>
There none could hurt me..."</span><br>
On right sea waving,<br>
On left train running.<br>
<span class="clr-m-w">"I'd hope again to stay in air forever...<br>
But just like this flat walkway is for upgoing..."</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="clr-b-mw">The feline</span>: <span class="clr-b-w">"Whither does this train head?"</span><br>
<span class="clr-w-mw">The possum</span>: <span class="clr-w-w">"Nowhere goes -- It only loops.<br>
Its only purpose to be is to power what we're on."</span><br>
-- <span class="clr-b-w">"The train to power this walk -- Then what powers the train?"</span><br>
-- <span class="clr-w-w">"It is connected to the world's train,<br>
Where men die slowly to be rendered<br>
Into the M a s s e.<br>
The soul consumed escapes through advertisement panels."</span>
</p>

<p>
To which <span class="clr-r-mw">the rabbit</span>: <span class="clr-r-w">"So in there we were to be purposedly tortured?"</span><br>
To which <span class="clr-m-mw">Magenta</span>: <span class="clr-m-w">"Not men but the world is.<br>
-- Or maybe at least not I.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="clr-m-w">"I hope my hours hurt televisions violated<br>
Become their nightmares!"</span>
