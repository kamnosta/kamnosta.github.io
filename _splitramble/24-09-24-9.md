<span class="clr-b-w">"Abominable rabbit! Why'd you do that?"</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="clr-r-w">"Don't threaten me with that which I defended, cat.<br>
It was I who've alarmed him from the dreams<br>
Dead that'll bury him unto th' accused soil.<br>
And here he should embrace the earth<br>
Drying his heart? My right objects.<br>
L'absurde driven heartbeat is of mine."</span>

<p>
I don't understand.
