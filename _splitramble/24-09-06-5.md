<p>
The aetherport.<br>
A long dull hallway. There <span class="clr-cyanic-siblings-mw">cyanic siblings</span> greet <span class="clr-w-mw">the possum</span> and her company.<br>
<span class="clr-m-mw">Magenta</span> thence: <span class="clr-m-w">"Hey, have we met before..."</span><br>
<span class="clr-cyanic-siblings-mw">The brother</span>: <span class="clr-cyanic-siblings-w">"Maybe our <i>other representations</i>."</span><br>
But <span class="clr-w-mw">White</span>: <span class="clr-w-w">"No, it's unlikely.<br>
Now where was I...<br>
We'll branchleap to the market."</span><br>
<span class="clr-cyanic-siblings-mw">The sister</span>: <span class="clr-cyanic-siblings-w">"Paying with cash I guess?"</span><br>
<span class="clr-w-mw">The possum</span>: <span class="clr-w-w">"Can you let us move already."</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="clr-m-mw">Magenta</span>: <span class="clr-m-w">"I'm a little bored...<br>
Detached lines from which I was bound...<br>
Ah, love... it is and has to be the sole excuse to think of there."</span>
